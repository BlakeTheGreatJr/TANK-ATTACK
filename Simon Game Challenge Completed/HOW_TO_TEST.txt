📋 CONTACT MANAGER - REAL-TIME SHARING GUIDE

✨ YOUR APP NOW HAS REAL-TIME CONTACT SHARING! ✨

HOW TO TEST IT (Takes 2 minutes):

1. OPEN TWO BROWSER WINDOWS:
   - Window 1: Open index.html
   - Window 2: Open the SAME index.html in another window/tab
   
   💡 TIP: Right-click the file → "Open with" → Choose your browser

2. ADD A CONTACT IN WINDOW 1:
   - Type: Name = "John Smith"
   - Type: Email = "john@example.com"
   - Click: "Add Contact"
   
3. LOOK AT WINDOW 2:
   - You should see "👥 John Smith" appear automatically with a green border
   - This means it's being shared in REAL-TIME!

4. COPY IT:
   - Click the "👥 Copy" button on the shared contact
   - Now it's in your own contacts list too

5. TRY MORE ADVANCED STUFF:
   - Edit the contact in Window 1
   - Edit your contact in Window 2 
   - Add different contacts in each window
   - All changes sync automatically!

WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES:
- Every 1 second, your app broadcasts your contacts to localStorage
- Every 1.5 seconds, your app checks if others have shared new contacts
- When it finds changes, it automatically refreshes the display
- Everything syncs without any server needed!

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
✓ Your own contacts = Normal display
✓ Shared contacts = 👥 badge + green left border
✓ Real-time updates = No need to refresh the page

ENJOY! 🎉
